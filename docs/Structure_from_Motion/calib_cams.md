# SfM with Calibrated Cameras

In the case where the cameras used are calibrated, we can use the known $K$ matrices to our advantage. For convenience, let's use *normalized image coordinates*:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    \bar{u} \\
    \bar{v} \\
    1
\end{bmatrix} = K^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
    u \\
    v \\
    1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

With $K$ known, we want to find $R$, $T$ and $P^i$ that satisfy:

$$
\begin{cases} 
\lambda_1 \begin{bmatrix}
\bar{u}_1^i \\
\bar{v}_1^i \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_w^i \\
Y_w^i \\
Z_w^i \\
1
\end{bmatrix} \\
\lambda_2 \begin{bmatrix}
\bar{u}_2^i \\
\bar{v}_2^i \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} R & T \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_w^i \\
Y_w^i \\
Z_w^i \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{cases}
$$

## Scale Ambiguity
If we rescale the entire scene and camera views by a constant factor (i.e. similarity transformation), the projections (in pixels) of the scene points in both images remain exactly the same.

In Structure from Motion, it is therefore not possible to recover the absolute scale of the scene!
- We can do this with stereo vision, because we have prior knowledge of the transformation between cameras (the baseline between the values gives a parameter in physical units).

Thus, only **5 degrees of freedom** are measurable:

- 3 parameters to describe the rotation
- 2 parameters for the translation up to a scale (we can only compute the direction of translation but not its length)

## Knowns & Unknowns
How many knowns and unknowns?

- $4n$ knowns:
    - $n$ correspondences, each one $(u_1^i, v_1^i)$ and $(u_2^i, v_2^i)$ for $i=1\dots n$
- $5+3n$ unknowns:
    - 5 for the motion up to a scale (3 for rotation, 2 for translation)
    - $3n$ = number of coordinates of the $n$ 3D points

Does a solution exist?

- If and only if the number of independent equations â‰¥ number of unknowns:

    $$
    4n \geq 5+3n \quad\rightarrow\quad n\geq 5
    $$

## Relative Motion Estimation
Can we solve the estimation of relative motion $(R, T)$ independently of the estimation of the 3D points? Yes! This section proves that this is possible.

### The Epipolar Constraint (Recap)
- The camera centers $C_1$, $C_2$ and one image point $p_1$ (or $p_2$) determine the so called **epipolar plane**.
- The intersections of the epipolar plane with the two image planes are called **epipolar lines**.
- **Corresponding points must therefore lie along the epipolar lines**: This constraint is called the epipolar constraint
- And alternative way to formulate the epipolar constraint is to notice that **two correponding image vectors plus the baseline must be coplanar**.

We know that $\bar{p}_1$, $\bar{p}_2$ and $T$ are **coplanar** :

$$
\bar{p}_2^T \cdot n = 0 \rightarrow
\bar{p}_2^T \cdot (T \times \bar{p}'_1) = 0 \rightarrow
\bar{p}_2^T(T \times (R\bar{p}_1)) = 0 \rightarrow
\bar{p}_2^T [T_\times R] \bar{p}_1 = 0
$$

!!! tip
    $\bar{p}'_1$ is the vector $\bar{p}_1$ in the scond camera's frame.

The resulting equation from the deduction above is the **epipolar constraint**:

$$
\bar{p}_2^T E \bar{p}_1^T = 0
$$

The the matrix $E$ is known as the **essential matrix**:

$$
E = [T_\times] R
$$

## How to compute the Essential matrix?

If we don't know $R$, $T$, can we estimate $E$ from two images?

- Yes, given at least 5 correspondences

## The 8-Point Algorithm
Each pair of correspondences $\bar{p}_1 = (\bar{u}_1, \bar{v}_1, 1)^T$, $\bar{p}_2 = (\bar{u}_2, \bar{v}_2, 1)^T$ provides a linear equation:

$$
\bar{p}_2^T E \bar{p}_1 = 0 \quad\text{with}\quad E = \begin{bmatrix}
e_{11} & e_{12} & e_{13} \\
e_{21} & e_{22} & e_{23} \\
e_{31} & e_{32} & e_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Leading to the equation:

$$
\bar{u}_2 \bar{u}_1 e\_{11} + \bar{u}_2 \bar{v}_1 e\_{12} + \bar{u}_2 e\_{13} + \bar{v}_2 \bar{u}_1 e\_{21} + \bar{v}_2 \bar{v}_1 e\_{22} + \bar{v}_2 e\_{23} + \bar{u}_1 e\_{31} + \bar{v}_1 e\_{32} + e\_{33} = 0
$$

for each point in 3D space seen by the two cameras. For $n$ points, we can write $QE = 0$, which expands to:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\bar{u}_2^1 \bar{u}_1^1 & \bar{u}_2^1 \bar{v}_1^1 & \bar{u}_2^1 & \bar{v}_2^1 \bar{u}_1^1 & \bar{v}_2^1 \bar{v}_1^1 & \bar{v}_2^1 & \bar{u}_1^1 & \bar{v}_1^1 & 1 \\\\
\bar{u}_2^2 \bar{u}_1^2 & \bar{u}_2^2 \bar{v}_1^2 & \bar{u}_2^2 & \bar{v}_2^2 \bar{u}_1^2 & \bar{v}_2^2 \bar{v}_1^2 & \bar{v}_2^2 & \bar{u}_1^2 & \bar{v}_1^2 & 1 \\\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\\\
\bar{u}_2^n \bar{u}_1^n & \bar{u}_2^n \bar{v}_1^n & \bar{u}_2^n & \bar{v}_2^n \bar{u}_1^n & \bar{v}_2^n \bar{v}_1^n & \bar{v}_2^n & \bar{u}_1^n & \bar{v}_1^n & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_{11} \\
e_{12} \\
e_{13} \\
e_{21} \\
e_{22} \\
e_{23} \\
e_{31} \\
e_{32} \\
e_{33}
\end{bmatrix} = 0
$$

The matrix $Q$ is known, whereas the matrix $E$ is unknown.

### Solving the 8-Point Algorithm
**Minimal Solution**

- $Q_{n\times 9}$ should have rank 8 to have a unique (up to scale) non-trivial solution $\bar{E}$
- Each point correspondence provides 1 independent equation
- Thus, 8 point correspondences are needed

**Over-Determined Solution**

- $n>8$ points
- A solution is to minimize $\|Q\bar{E}\|^2$ subject to the constraint $\|\bar{E}\|^2 = 1$
    The solution is the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix $Q^T Q$ (because it is the unit vector $x$ that minimizes $\|Qx\|^2 = x^T Q^T Q x$).
- It can be solved through singular value decomposition (SVD)

**Degenerate Configurations**

- The solution of the 8-point algorithm is **degenerate when the 3D points are coplanar**.
- Conversely, the 5-point algorithm works also for coplanar points.

## Extract $R$ and $T$ from $E$
Singular value decomposition yields the following: $E = U \Sigma V^T$.

Enforcing a rank-2 constraint: We set the smallest singular value of $\Sigma$ to 0:

$$
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \sigma_2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \sigma_3
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \sigma_2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\hat{T} = U \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & \mp 1 & 0 \\
    \pm 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} \Sigma V^T \quad \text{where} \quad \hat{T} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & -t_z & t_y \\
    t_z & 0 & t_x \\
    -t_y & t_x & 0
    \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \hat{t} = \begin{bmatrix} t_x \\ t_y \\ t_z \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\hat{R} = U \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & \mp 1 & 0 \\
    \pm 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} V^T
$$

Therefore $R$ and $T$ can be found as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
    T &= K_2 \hat{t} \\
    R &= K_2 \hat{R} K_1^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

Such an answer gives four possible solutions. However, thereis only one solution where the points are in front of both cameras:
